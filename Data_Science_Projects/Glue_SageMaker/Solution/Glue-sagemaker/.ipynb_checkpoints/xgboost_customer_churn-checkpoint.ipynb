Note, if more than one role is required for notebook instances, training, and/or hosting, please replace the boto regexp with a the appropriate full IAM role arn string(s)."

We can use this historical information to construct an ML model of one mobile operator’s churn using a process called training.

    "Now that we've cleaned up our dataset, let's determine which algorithm to use.  As mentioned above, there appear to be some variables where both high and low (but not intermediate) values are predictive of churn.  In order to accommodate this in an algorithm like linear regression, we'd need to generate polynomial (or bucketed) terms.  Instead, let's attempt to model this problem using gradient boosted trees.  Amazon SageMaker provides an XGBoost container that we can use to train in a managed, distributed setting, and then host as a real-time prediction endpoint.  XGBoost uses gradient boosted trees which naturally account for non-linear relationships between features and the target variable, as well as accommodating complex interactions between features.\n",

    "- `max_depth` controls how deep each tree within the algorithm can be built.  Deeper trees can lead to better fit, but are more computationally expensive and can lead to overfitting.  There is typically some trade-off in model performance that needs to be explored between a large number of shallow trees and a smaller number of deeper trees.\n",
    "- `subsample` controls sampling of the training data.  This technique can help reduce overfitting, but setting it too low can also starve the model of data.\n",
    "- `num_round` controls the number of boosting rounds.  This is essentially the subsequent models that are trained using the residuals of previous iterations.  Again, more rounds should produce a better fit on the training data, but can be computationally expensive or lead to overfitting.\n",
    "- `eta` controls how aggressive each round of boosting is.  Larger values lead to more conservative boosting.\n",
